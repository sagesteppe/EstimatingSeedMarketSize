When it comes to 'measuring' NLCD areas - hardwood forests can be 'omitted' they will naturally regenerate without active restoration. 

SGI has determined 'workhorse' species for all 55 National Parks based on plot data, and their expertise. Tally across all Parks, and total habitat area. 

For the NPS areas, including Pasture and Hay lands is neccessary. I could verify that Gettysburg battlefield NP is classified by NLCD as pasture/hay area.
